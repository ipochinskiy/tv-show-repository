# TV Show Tracker

A small project to try out AngularJS and some other packages/libraries.

It's a client-server application for tracking TV series which are imported from [The TVDB](http://thetvdb.com/).

Server-side is based on Express and MongoDB (via Mongoose). Authentication and signup are implemented with Passport. The backend provides REST API for a browser client, which is built using AngularJS and Bootstrap Sass. Gulp is used as a build system.
