# TV Show Tracker

![](http://sahatyalkabov.com/images/projects/showtrackr.png)

A client-server application for tracking TV series which are imported from [The TVDB](http://thetvdb.com/).

Server-side is based on Express and MongoDB (via Mongoose). Authentication and signup are implemented with Passport. The backend provides REST API for a browser client, which is built using AngularJS and Bootstrap Sass. Gulp is used as a build system.

This project is built based on the [article](http://sahatyalkabov.com/create-a-tv-show-tracker-using-angularjs-nodejs-and-mongodb/) by [Sahat Yalkabov](https://github.com/sahat).
